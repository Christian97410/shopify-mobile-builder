# 🧱 Mobile App Builder (Shopify-like)

A mobile-first, no-code builder inspired by Shopify’s theme editor. This project enables users to visually design mobile application interfaces using a familiar section-based customization logic. The ultimate objective is seamless exportation of these designs into native mobile applications available on iOS and Android stores.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Mobile-first Live Preview:** Design interfaces directly in a realistic mobile mockup environment.
- **Section & Block-Based Layout:** Mirror Shopify's intuitive customization model to minimize the learning curve.
- **Dynamic Components:** Easily insert components (header, product grid, text, navigation, etc.) via a sidebar.
- **Real-time Data Integration:** Pull live data from Shopify’s Storefront API.
- **Project Persistence:** Save and manage your projects efficiently.
- **Native App Export:** Structured for eventual export to React Native or Progressive Web Apps (PWA).

## 🎯 Vision

This builder aims to replicate the effortless usability and familiarity of Shopify’s theme customization tool. The goal is to completely eliminate the learning curve for Shopify users transitioning to mobile app creation.

**Long-term ambitions include:**
- Community-driven creation of themes and components.
- Easy exportation of projects to fully native apps for both iOS and Android.
- Establishing a vibrant marketplace for mobile UI themes inspired by Shopify’s theme ecosystem.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React & TypeScript** for frontend robustness
- **TailwindCSS** for streamlined styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Supabase** for backend-as-a-service (authentication & storage)
- **Shopify Storefront API** for dynamic content
- **Vite** for fast and optimized development

## 🧩 Component Logic

Layout JSON structure for flexible component definition:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "product-grid",
      "props": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

This structured approach facilitates an easy export into native application codebases.
